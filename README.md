# Capstone_Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Capstone_Project** is my final-year capstone project focusing on processing geospatial / tile-based data and performing analysis through Jupyter Notebooks.  
The repository includes data-preparation workflows, final analysis, and documentation showcasing my skills in Python, data processing, and visualization.

## 🧰 Repository Contents
- **prepare_tiles.ipynb** — Notebook for preparing/cleaning raw data tiles.  
- **Roads_Final_2.ipynb** — Main analysis notebook used for final outputs.  
- **PSCS_75_IEEE_REVIEW.docx** — Project report/documentation.

## ✅ Features
- Reads and processes raw tile/geospatial datasets.  
- Performs cleaning, transformation, cropping, and preparation steps.  
- Generates visualizations and final analysis outputs.  
- Includes end-to-end workflow from raw data → processed results → final report.

## 🔧 Requirements
To run the notebooks locally, you’ll need:
- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  
- Libraries such as:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `geopandas` *(if geospatial data used)*  
  - any other required libs depending on data format.

Install them with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas jupyter
```
# How to Run
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manas-saradva/Capstone_Project.git
cd Capstone_Project

# 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas jupyter

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
Then open:

prepare_tiles.ipynb → preprocess and clean raw tiles

Roads_Final_2.ipynb → final analysis, visualization, and output generation

🧪 Usage

Run the preprocessing notebook first.

Load processed data in the final notebook.

Export results or view them inside the notebook.

Final documentation is available in the included .docx report.

🛠️ Possible Extensions

Add more preprocessing utilities.

Convert notebook logic into modular Python scripts.

Include ML-based feature extraction or predictive modelling.

Automate data ingestion for large datasets.
